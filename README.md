# Competitive Programming Library

Implementations of common algorithms and data structures used in competitive/sports programming.

## Installation
NOTE: The suggest way is to clone the repository as it can incorporate future updates to the library.

1. Clone to the desired location by
```bash
# HTTP based
git clone https://github.com/madhur4127/libcp.git
# SSH based
git clone git@github.com:madhur4127/libcp.git
```
2. Download the library using [this link](https://github.com/madhur4127/libcp/archive/master.zip).

## Usage
The contents of the library files are developed to be copy pastable to the source code, hence it doesn't require `#include` inorder to use.  Usage depends on your development environment:
1. Vim: In order to include the contents of library's in the currently opened file. Use `:r <file-name>` syntax. For example, to include code for fastIO `:r libcp/fastIO.h`.
2. IDEs: If you'are modern IDE's then add the path to the library in the search path of your IDE. Since it depends on IDE, search for your IDE.

## A gentle note
All the codes in this repository are not entirely of my own, some of them are common in the folklore. Wherever possible, I have tried to add the author of the code.
